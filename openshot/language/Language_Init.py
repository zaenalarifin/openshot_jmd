#   ----------------------------- EXAMPLE CODE ----------------------------
#   Use this snippet on any module that needs to support translations.  Once this 
#   snippet is in place, you can use the _("") method to set all your strings.
#
#	   import language.Language_Init as Language_Init
#
#	   # Add this to each method that needs to translate strings
#	   _ = Language_Init.Translator().lang.gettext
#
#	   # To mark a string as 'translatable', use this syntax:
#	   MyString = _("Here is my string")



# ----------------------- GENERATE THE POT FILE --------------------
# To generate the POT file, which contains all translatable text in
# OpenShot, run the Generate_POT.py script (in this same folder)
# Example:  $ python Generate_POT.py
#
# Ignore warnings, and the new POT file should be located at
# /openshot/openshot/locale/OpenShot/OpenShot.pot



# Command to Launch Program in any language
# LANG=es python OpenShot.py
#
# *** TROUBLESHOOTING TIPS:  If you get the following error: 
# (process:27990): Gtk-WARNING **: Locale not supported by C library. Using the fallback 'C' locale.
# 
# SOLUTION:  Step 1) Modify this file and add your language: /var/lib/locales/supported.d/local
#            Step 2) sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales
#            Step 3) Be sure the correct translation file localted at /usr/local/share/openshot/openshot/language/
#               NOTE:  fr <> fr_FR.  You must match the language code exactly.
