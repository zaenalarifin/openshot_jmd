.SH DESCRIPTION
OpenShot Video Editor is a program designed to create videos on 
Linux.  It can easily combine multiple video clips, audio clips, 
and images into a single project, and then export the video into 
many common video formats.

OpenShot is a non-linear video editor, which means any frame of 
video can be accessed at any time, and thus the video clips can 
be layered, mixed, and arranged in very creative ways.  All 
video clip edits (trimming, cutting, etc...) are non-destructive, 
meaning that the original video clips are never modified.

You can use OpenShot to create photo slide shows, edit home videos, 
create television commercials and on-line films, or anything else 
you can dream up.
